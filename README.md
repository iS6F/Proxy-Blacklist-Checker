# Proxy-Blacklist-Checker
Minimal script thats checks if multiple proxys are blacklisted from websites via "www.xmyip.com" with the power of bs4 and requests in under 35 lines
the program in the current state is slow due to the "www.xmyip.com" website but i might update it in the future and add multi-poccessing and maybe change the source website
